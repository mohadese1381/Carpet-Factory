# Carpet Factory Simulation (Java)

A structured Java implementation simulating a carpet manufacturing workflow, designed for the *Design and Analysis of Algorithms* course.  
The project focuses on algorithmic optimization, object-oriented modeling, and complexity-aware decision structures.

## Features
- End-to-end simulation of a carpet production lifecycle
- Modular OOP design (Factory, Order, Machine, Worker, Process Units)
- Recursive and iterative process flows
- Time and cost optimization logic
- Input-driven simulation with multiple product configurations

## Algorithms & Techniques Used
- **Greedy strategies** for machine/workstation assignment  
- **Divide-and-conquer** logic for splitting production tasks  
- **Recursive workflow simulation**  
- **Scheduling heuristics** for minimizing production time  
- **Complexity-driven design** (analyzed worst-case time for major functions)  
- **State-based modeling** for machine/worker transitions  

## Technologies
- Java  
- Object-Oriented Design  
- Custom Data Structures (lists, queues, processing units)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Compile the Java files.  
3. Run the main simulation class.  
4. Provide input configuration for carpet type, size, and production constraints.
